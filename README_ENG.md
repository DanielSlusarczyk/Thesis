## :small_blue_diamond: Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify">
The electricity market is constantly transforming. One of the reasons for this situation is the tendency
to increase the use of renewable energy sources. As a result, the prosumer as a participant of the power
grid is becoming continuously even more important. Prosumers are capable of not only consuming
electrical energy but also actively producing it using their own micro-installations. The consequence
of the widespread production of energy by low-power devices is an increase in the problem of the
energy imbalance, i.e. a situation where the produced energy does not align with the actual demand.
The complex and unpredictable energy consumption of individuals with their own installations poses
logistical and financial challenges for energy companies, resulting in increased operational costs and
ineï¬€icient use of produced energy. Solving this problem would allow to increase network reliability
as well as improve integration of micro-installations with central energy sources managed by the
operator. An effectively functioning system would be an additional advantage supporting further
development of renewable energy produced at the level of private activity.

This study attempts to contribute to solving the imbalance problem by using machine learning to
create a model capable of predicting prosumer behavior. The purpose of the created implementation is
short-term prediction of energy consumption and production of a given group of prosumers in Estonia.
The paper begins with a description of the theoretical basis that are important from the point of view
of the discussed subject and an exploratory analysis of the available information. The experimental
part of the study includes the introduction of eight prepared prediction models implemented using
random forest, the XGBoost system and linear regression. The research ends with the selection of
the most effective solution in terms of the adopted criteria and the final conclusion. The developed
solution can be an effective tool from the perspective of the electrical grid operator and the basis for
further research of the subject.
